# kzg-commitments-study

Doing this to study and learn [KZG commitments](http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/techreports/2010/cacr2010-10.pdf), do not use in production.

Thanks to [Dankrad Feist](https://dankradfeist.de/ethereum/2020/06/16/kate-polynomial-commitments.html), [Alin Tomescu](https://alinush.github.io/2020/05/06/kzg-polynomial-commitments.html), [Tom Walton-Pocock](https://hackmd.io/@tompocock/Hk2A7BD6U) for their articles, which helped me understand a bit the KZG Commitments.
